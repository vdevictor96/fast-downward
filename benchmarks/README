Exercise benchmark set, 1 domain from IPC'08, 5 domains from IPC'11.
For many details on all IPC'11 benchmarks, see:

Here we briefly list our selection, and specifics of the instances we
selected. ATTENTION: The "huge" instances are intended only for
running satisficing planners, they are beyond the scalability of
optimal planning.

-- nomystery: A logistics problem where the truck movements are constrained
   by fuel consumption. Instances scale by size, small -- medium --
   large -- huge.

-- parcprinter: The large-scale printing system control application
   from Chapter 4 of the lecture. Domain and instances provided to the
   IPC by the developers of that application. Instances scale by size,
   small -- medium -- large -- huge. The domain file is individualized
   per instance, so you have to use matching instance/domain files in
   each call to the planner.

-- scanalyzer: An application involving the control of conveyor belts
   in a greenhouse. Complicated because moving a belt moves all plants
   on it, whereas the goal may be to move just one of them. Instances scale
   by size, small -- medium -- large -- huge.

-- sokoban: The game involving pushing stones through a maze of
   rooms. Instances scale by size, small -- medium -- large -- huge.

-- transport: Another logistics problem where each truck can load only
   a restrictive number of packages at the same time, given by the capacity.
   Instances scale by size, small -- medium -- large -- huge.

-- visitall: A very simple domain where one starts in the middle of a
   grid, and needs to visit all locations. The
   domain was designed for the sole purpose of showing the limitations
   of delete-relaxation heuristics (which do not account for the
   back-and-forth needed to solve such tasks). Instances scale by
   size, small -- medium -- large -- huge.
