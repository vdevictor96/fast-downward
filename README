This document contains information on how to compile and run FD, and
also some issues concerning the implementation of heuristics that
occurred in previous years.


COMPILING FD

Linux: Before you can compile FD, you need to have cmake, python and either
g++ or clang installed. To compile FD, go to the root FD directory and run
./build.py. You can run ./build.py debug32 to build in debug mode.

Windows: You need to install CMake (https://cmake.org/download/) to build
Visual Studio project files for FD. Run the CMake GUI, then select the
<FD>/src and <FD>/builds directories as source and build directory. Then
you have to click the "Configure" button and select your Visual Studio
version (Visual Studio 2015 is called Visual Studio 14, the version number
does not match the year). We recommend to use the 32 bit version, otherwise
you will have to set the ALLOW_64BIT flag to True. Press Finish and then
click on the "Generate" button. You can find the generated Visual Studio
project files in <FD>/builds. You can build the planner by building the
fast-downward.sln solution.
Note: There is an alternative way to build the project for windows using
the build.py script. The script must be run in a Visual Studio developer
console. For Visual Studio 2015, you have to start a shell (cmd) and then
call the VsDevCmd.bat script which should be located in your Visual Studio
directory at <Visual Studio directory>\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat. However,
we did not test this method and cannot provide support if it does not work.


RUNNING FD

FD performs search on a finite-domain representation of the given
planning tasks. In order to get such a representation, before the
actual search the translation takes place. "translate" will translate
the PDDL input to FDR, while "preprocess" performs some
pre-calculations (such as calculation of the causal graph and the
domain transition graph etc.). These two programs need not be changed
for this course.

Finally, the actual search is implemented in the directory
<FD>/src/search. The directory contains a skeleton for the heuristics 
and other methods you will be required to implement.

To run FD, you can use the python driver script <FD>/fast-downward.py
with the following syntax:
./fast-downward.py <problem-file> <search-options>
where <problem-file> is the path to the *.pddl file of the problem that you
want the planner to solve. Note that to precompute the planning task, FD
also needs the corresponding *.pddl domain file. The script automatically
detects which domain file it should use, if the domain and problem file
are in the same folder. If for some reason this does not work, you can use
./fast-downward.py <domain-file> <problem-file> <search-options>
instead.
<search-options> usually is of the form --search "parameters", where
the parameters specify the search type and heuristic that is to be used.
E.g. a command starting the planner on the small elevators instance with
weighted A* search (weight of 1) and a blind heuristic looks as follows:
./fast-downward.py benchmarks/elevators/small.pddl --search
"wastar(blind(), w=1)"

To run FD in debug mode, simply run:
./fast-downward.py --build debug32 <problem-file> <search-options>

The driver script automatically takes care of first running translate
(resulting in a file "output.sas", the result of grounding the task), then
running preprocess (taking "output.sas" as input and resulting in a file
"output", the result of the further preprocessing steps), and finally
running the planner with the corresponding parameters.


ADDING A NEW HEURISTIC

In this course, you will typically be asked to implement new
heuristics to this stripped version of FastDownward. You can have a
look at the blind heuristic as a basis (in
<FD>/src/search/heuristics/blind_heuristic.{cc,h}). The blind heuristic
first determines the smallest action cost (in the constructor of this
heuristic), and later on returns a value that is either 0 (in case of
goal states) or the determined smallest action cost (in all other
cases). Note that, since we are only using uniform-cost domains, the
smallest action cost will always be 1.

If you want to add additional files to your project, make sure to add them to
the list of planner files in the <FD>/src/search/DownwardFiles.cmake file (in
the list of files for the planner component starting at line 94). If you want
to add .cc and .h files with identical names, you only need to add the .cc
file to the list and the .h file will be found automatically.



Use of the heuristic within the search code:

Every heuristic has two important functions:
 - initialize, and
 - compute_heuristic
"initialize" will be called only once, at the very beginning of the
search, and should precalculate whatever makes sense here.
"compute_heuristic" takes as argument a state and is called once for
each state. This should return the actual heuristic value of the given
state.


IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

All globally defined variables can be found in globals.{cc,h}. Several
of those are important for the heuristic implementations:
 - g_variable_domain stores the domain sizes of all variables, i.e.,
   for 0 <= i < g_variable_domain.size(), g_variable_domain[i] gives
   the number of values of the respective variable.
 - For each variable, g_fact_names[i][j] stores the string (e.g.,
   "Atom in-city(truck01, adelaide)") representing value j of variable
   i.
 - g_goal is a vector of pairs. The first element of such a pair is
   the index of a variable, the second its value. Only variables that
   are mentioned in the goal description in PDDL will be captured in
   this vector. A state is considered a goal state if all variables
   mentioned in the goal have the value that is stored in g_goal for
   that variable.
 - g_operators is a vector of operators. More on these in the next
   section
 - test_goal(state) is a global function that takes a state and
   returns whether or not it satisfies the goal condition.


Concerning the operators:

An operator stores
 - the variables that are queried in the precondition (vector
   "preconditions")
 - the variables that are changed in the effect of the operator (vector
   "effects")
Assume you have an operator op.
Use "const vector<Condition> &preconditions = op.get_preconditions()"
to get a reference to the precondition vector of operator op.
(Note: omitting the "&" will create a copy -- please make sure to use
references to vectors, maps, etc. whenever possible; copying the entire
content will make your program extremely inefficient). preconditions[i].var
is then the index of the i-th variable stored in precondition, and
preconditions[i].val its required value in the operator's precondition

Similarly, "const vector<Effect> &effects = op.get_effects()" gives
you a reference to the effects vector. Here, effects[i].var is again
the index of the i-th variable stored in effects, while effects[i].val is
the value the variable will take when applying the effect.


Concerning the heuristic:

 - In some cases you will have to implement a special treatment of the
   value infinity. For example, both the minimization and the
   maximization in the hmax/hadd equations may contain recursive calls whose
   value is infinite; the minimization may be over an empty set and
   thus evaluate to infinity itself. As you never know how large
   action costs etc. may become, it is *not* possible to implement
   infinity by a large constant. Instead, implement a special case
   treatment. Make sure that treatment is correct (in particular) in
   minimization and maximization (standard implementations may not
   treat your encoding of infinity in the way intended).  
 - In case the heuristic value computed is infinity, you should
   "return DEAD_END;".
 - In the calculation of the heuristic value of a given state, you can
   access the values of the variables via state[i] (this is the value
   of the variable with index i). Each state contains all variables,
   and the variables are ordered in the same way as in
   g_variable_names etc. (in globals.cc).
   
   
DEBUGGING

As already mentioned above, you can compile and run Fast Downward in debug
mode. This enables all assertions in the code as well as all code snippets
guarded by:
#ifndef NDEBUG
[..]
#endif
You can (and should) use both possibilities to check that your code is 
indeed doing what it should do. In our experiments, we will execute FD
in standard mode, so such assertions and tests will not influence performance.


TECHNICAL REMARKS

Feel free to use the boost library in your project. To enable boost in your
build you only need to uncomment the "#    DEPENDS BOOST" line in the
<FD>/src/search/DownwardFiles.cmake file (line 118). The boost installation
on our servers is version 1.53, so make sure that your code is compatible
with it when using a newer version of boost.

For our tests your code will be built using g++ version 4.8.5, please ensure
that your project compiles with that version of g++.
