// Usage example: the command line option for using enforced hill climbing
// using heuristic with name h is
// ./fast-downward.py [path-to-PDDL-problem-file] --search "ehc(h())"
// So, for the h^{FF} heuristic
// ./fast-downward.py [path-to-PDDL-problem-file] --search "ehc(ff())"
// For h^{add}
// ./fast-downward.py [path-to-PDDL-problem-file] --search "ehc(hadd())"
// And so on.
// To enable helpful actions you additionally need to pass helpful_actions=true,
// so for example running enforced hill climbing with h^{FF} and helpful actions:
// ./fast-downward.py [path-to-PDDL-problem-file] --search "ehc(ff(), helpful_actions=true)"
// Obviously, [path-to-PDDL-problem-file] has to be replaced by the actual path
// to the PDDL problem file.


// The implementation of enforced hill climbing goes here. In particular
// consider the various TODO tags distributed across the code in
// enforced_hill_climbing.cc
