## Details of the plugins
#
# For now, everything defaults to being enabled - it's up to the user to specify
#    -DPLUGIN_FOO_ENABLED=FALSE
# to disable a given plugin.
#
# Defining a new plugin:
#    fast_downward_plugin(
#        NAME <NAME>
#        [ DISPLAY_NAME <DISPLAY_NAME> ]
#        [ HELP <HELP> ]
#        SOURCES
#            <FILE_1> [ <FILE_2> ... ]
#        [ DEPENDS <PLUGIN_NAME_1> [ <PLUGIN_NAME_2> ... ] ]
#        [ DEPENDENCY_ONLY ]
#        [ CORE_PLUGIN ]
#    )
#
# <DISPLAY_NAME> defaults to lower case <NAME> and is used to group
#                files in IDEs and for messages.
# <HELP> defaults to <DISPLAY_NAME> and is used to describe the cmake option.
# DEPENDS lists plugins that will be automatically enabled if this plugin
# is enabled. If the dependency was not enabled before, this will be logged.
# DEPENDENCY_ONLY disables the plugin unless it is needed as a dependency and
#     hides the option to enable the plugin in cmake GUIs like ccmake.
# CORE_PLUGIN enables the plugin and hides the option to disable it in
#     cmake GUIs like ccmake.

option(
  DISABLE_PLUGINS_BY_DEFAULT
  "If set to YES only plugins that are specifically enabled will be compiled"
  NO)
# This option should not show up in cmake GUIs like ccmake where all
# plugins are enabled or disabled manually.

# The order in PLANNER_SOURCES influences the order in which object
# files are given to the linker, which can have a significant influence
# on performance (see issue67). The general recommendation seems to be
# to list files that define functions after files that use them.
# We approximate this by reversing the list, which will put the plugins
# first, followed by the core files, followed by the main file.
# This is certainly not optimal, but works well enough in practice.
